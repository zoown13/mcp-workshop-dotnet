# 01: Monkey App Development with MCP

In this step, you're building a simple console app using MCP servers.

## Prerequisites

Refer to the [README](../README.md#prerequisites) doc for preparation.

## Getting Started

- [Check GitHub Copilot Agent Mode](#check-github-copilot-agent-mode)
- [Start MCP Server – GitHub](#start-mcp-server--github)
- [Prepare Custom Instructions](#prepare-custom-instructions)
- [Scaffold Console App](#scaffold-console-app)
- [Manage GitHub Repository](#manage-github-repository)
- [Start MCP Server – Monkey MCP](#start-mcp-server--monkey-mcp)
- [Develop Monkey App with GitHub Copilot and MCP Servers](#develop-monkey-app-with-github-copilot-and-mcp-servers)

## Check GitHub Copilot Agent Mode

1. Click the GitHub Copilot icon on the top of GitHub Codespace or VS Code and open GitHub Copilot window.

1. If you're asked to login or sign up, do it. It's free of charge.
1. Make sure you're using GitHub Copilot Agent Mode.

1. Select model to either `GPT-4.1` or `Claude Sonnet 4`.
1. Make sure that you've configured [MCP Servers](./00-setup.md#set-up-mcp-servers).

## Start MCP Server &ndash; GitHub

1. Open Command Palette by typing `F1` or `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`P` on Windows or `Cmd`+`Shift`+`P` on Mac OS, and search `MCP: List Servers`.
1. Choose `github` then click `Start Server`. You might be asked to login to GitHub to use this MCP server.

## Prepare Custom Instructions

1. Set the environment variable of `$REPOSITORY_ROOT`.

   ```bash
   # bash/zsh
   REPOSITORY_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
   ```

   ```powershell
   # PowerShell
   $REPOSITORY_ROOT = git rev-parse --show-toplevel
   ```

1. Copy custom instructions.

    ```bash
    # bash/zsh
    cp $REPOSITORY_ROOT/docs/.github/monkeyapp-instructions.md \
       $REPOSITORY_ROOT/.github/copilot-instructions.md
    ```

    ```powershell
    # PowerShell
    Copy-Item -Path $REPOSITORY_ROOT/docs/.github/monkeyapp-instructions.md `
              -Destination $REPOSITORY_ROOT/.github/copilot-instructions.md -Force
    ```

1. Open `.github/copilot-instructions.md` and replace `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME` with yours. For example, `https://github.com/octocat/monkey-app`.

## Scaffold Console App

1. Create a console app under the `workshop` directory.

    ```bash
    # bash/zsh
    mkdir -p $REPOSITORY_ROOT/workshop
    cd $REPOSITORY_ROOT/workshop
    dotnet new console -n MyMonkeyApp
    ```

    ```powershell
    # PowerShell
    New-Item -Type Directory -Path $REPOSITORY_ROOT/workshop -Force
    cd $REPOSITORY_ROOT/workshop
    dotnet new console -n MyMonkeyApp
    ```

## Manage GitHub Repository

1. Enter the following prompt to GitHub Copilot to push the scaffolded console app.

    ```text
    Push the current changes to the `main` branch of the repository.
    ```

1. Enter the following prompt to GitHub Copilot to generate an issue on the repository.

    ```text
    Create a new GitHub issue in my repository titled 'Implement Monkey Console Application' with the following requirements:
    
    - Create a C# console app that can list all available monkeys, get details for a specific monkey by name, and pick a random monkey.
    - The app should use a Monkey model class and include ASCII art for visual appeal.
    - Add appropriate labels like 'enhancement' and 'good first issue'.
    - Add some details about how we may go about implementing this and a checklist for what we will need to do.
    ```

1. Assign `@Copilot` to the issue and watch what is happening.

## Start MCP Server &ndash; Monkey MCP

1. Open Command Palette by typing `F1` or `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`P` on Windows or `Cmd`+`Shift`+`P` on Mac OS, and search `MCP: List Servers`.
1. Make sure the `github` MCP server is up and running.
1. Choose `monkeymcp` then click `Start Server`.

## Develop Monkey App with GitHub Copilot and MCP Servers

1. Enter the following prompt to get the list of monkeys.

    ```text
    Get me a list of monkeys that are available and display them in a table with their details.
    ```

1. Enter the following prompt to get an idea of data model for a monkey.

    ```text
    What would a data model look like for this structure?
    ```

1. Enter the following prompt to create a file for the data model class.

    ```text
    Let's create a new file for this class.
    ```

1. Enter the following prompt to create a `MonkeyHelper` class.

    ```text
    Let's create a new class called MonkeyHelper that is static. It should manage a collection of monkey data. Include methods to get all monkeys, get a random monkey, find a monkey by name, and track access count to when a random monkey is picked. The data for the monkeys should come from the Monkey MCP server that we just got.
    ```

1. Enter the following prompt to update the console app.

    ```text
    Let's update the app now to have a nice menu with the following options that will call into that `MonkeyHelper`.
    
    1. List all monkeys
    2. Get details for a specific monkey by name
    3. Get a random monkey
    4. Exit app

    Also display some funny ASCII art randomly.
    ```

1. Enter the following prompt to GitHub Copilot to push the updated console app.

    ```text
    Push the current changes to the `mymonkeyapp` branch of the repository.
    Before pushing the changes, make sure the `workshop` directory should be included in the push.
    With this branch, create a PR against the `main` branch of your repository, not the upstream one.
    Connect this PR to the issue created before.
    Then, merge this PR and close the issue.
    ```

OK. You've completed the "Monkey App Development with MCP" step. Let's move onto [STEP 02: MCP Server](./02-mcp-server.md).
