# 00: Development Environment

In this step, you're setting up the development environment for the workshop.

## Prerequisites

Refer to the [README](../README.md#prerequisites) doc for preparation.

## Getting Started

- [Use GitHub Codespaces](#use-github-codespaces)
- [Use Visual Studio Code](#use-visual-studio-code)
  - [Install PowerShell 👉 For Windows Users](#install-powershell--for-windows-users)
  - [Install git CLI](#install-git-cli)
  - [Install GitHub CLI](#install-github-cli)
  - [Install Docker Desktop](#install-docker-desktop)
  - [Install Visual Studio Code](#install-visual-studio-code)
  - [Start Visual Studio Code](#start-visual-studio-code)
- [Set-up MCP Servers](#set-up-mcp-servers)
- [Check GitHub Copilot Agent Mode](#check-github-copilot-agent-mode)

## Use GitHub Codespaces

1. Click this link 👉 [![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/Azure-Samples/mcp-workshop-dotnet)

1. Once the GitHub Codespace instance is ready, open a terminal and run the following commands to verify that everything you need has been properly installed.

    ```bash
    # Node.js
    node --version
    npm --version
    ```

    ```bash
    # .NET SDK
    dotnet --list-sdks
    ```

    ```bash
    # PowerShell
    pwsh --version
    ```

1. Check your repository status.

    ```bash
    git remote -v
    ```

   You should see the following output:

    ```bash
    origin  https://github.com/Azure-Samples/mcp-workshop-dotnet.git (fetch)
    origin  https://github.com/Azure-Samples/mcp-workshop-dotnet.git (push)
    ```

   If you see something different from above, delete the GitHub Codespace instance and recreate it.

1. Move down to the [Set-up MCP Servers](#set-up-mcp-servers) section.

**👇👇👇 If you'd like to use VS Code on your local machine instead, follow the instruction below. The section below doesn't apply to those who use GitHub Codespaces. 👇👇👇**

## Use Visual Studio Code

### Start Visual Studio Code

1. Create a working directory.
1. Run the command to fork this repo and clone it to your local machine.

    ```bash
    gh repo fork Azure-Samples/mcp-workshop-dotnet --clone
    ```

1. Navigate into the cloned directory.

    ```bash
    cd mcp-workshop-dotnet
    ```

1. Run VS Code from the terminal.

    ```bash
    code .
    ```

1. Open a new terminal within VS Code and run the following command to check your repository status.

    ```bash
    git remote -v
    ```

   You should see the following output. If you see `Azure-Samples` in the `origin`, you should clone it again from your forked repository.

    ```bash
    origin  https://github.com/<your GitHub ID>/mcp-workshop-dotnet.git (fetch)
    origin  https://github.com/<your GitHub ID>/mcp-workshop-dotnet.git (push)
    upstream        https://github.com/Azure-Samples/mcp-workshop-dotnet.git (fetch)
    upstream        https://github.com/Azure-Samples/mcp-workshop-dotnet.git (push)
    ```

1. Check whether both extensions have been installed: [GitHub Copilot](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot) and [GitHub Copilot Chat](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot-chat).

    ```bash
    # Bash/Zsh
    code --list-extensions | grep github.copilot
    ```

    ```powershell
    # PowerShell
    code --list-extensions | Select-String "github.copilot"
    ```

   If you see nothing, it means you haven't installed those extensions yet. Run the following command to install the extensions.

    ```bash
    code --install-extension "github.copilot" --force && code --install-extension "github.copilot-chat" --force
    ```

## Set-up MCP Servers

1. Set the environment variable of `$REPOSITORY_ROOT`.

   ```bash
   # bash/zsh
   REPOSITORY_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
   ```

   ```powershell
   # PowerShell
   $REPOSITORY_ROOT = git rev-parse --show-toplevel
   ```

1. Copy MCP server settings.

    ```bash
    # bash/zsh
    cp -r $REPOSITORY_ROOT/docs/.vscode/. \
          $REPOSITORY_ROOT/.vscode/
    ```

    ```powershell
    # PowerShell
    Copy-Item -Path $REPOSITORY_ROOT/docs/.vscode/* `
              -Destination $REPOSITORY_ROOT/.vscode/ -Recurse -Force
    ```

## Check GitHub Copilot Agent Mode

1. Click the GitHub Copilot icon on the top of GitHub Codespace or VS Code and open GitHub Copilot window.

1. If you're asked to login or sign up, do it. It's free of charge.
1. Make sure you're using GitHub Copilot Agent Mode.
